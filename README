shred an audio file; play with the pieces

Introduction
============

Grainmap splits an audio file at onsets and displays each slice as a
region on a map.  Regions which are nearby on the map correspond to
audio slices that are nearby in time.  Brightly colored regions
correspond to loud audio slices.  Darker regions that have a few
bright patches correspond to low-volume audio slices that have a few
loud peaks.  Colors are chosen so that each region is visually
distinguishable to its neighbors.

Once the audio file is loaded, clicking on any particular region
causes the corresponding audio slice to play.  Slices are played
continuously forward and backward.  Dragging your mouse across the map
creates a granular style effect.
